**Books Page:**
- "Not the names given by others" → "The deeper ones that hold your form from within rise to the surface"

- "rather than recognition" → Removed

**Not-Found Page:**
- "doesn't exist" → "is unavailable"

### 4. Varied Language for "Field" and "Architecture"

**"Field" variations:**
- "field" → "system" (in most contexts)
- "field research" → "direct research" or "research"
- "the field" → "the system"
- "coherent field" → "coherent system"
- "field that predates" → "system that predates"
- "living field" → "living system"
- "field encoded within" → "system encoded within"
- "field integrity" → "system integrity"
- "field report" → "report" (when used generically)
- **Kept "Sovereign Field"** as proper noun/concept name

**"Architecture" variations:**
- "architecture" → "design" (in most contexts)
- "architecture of awareness" → "design of awareness"
- "architecture that already shapes" → "design that already shapes"
- "architecture is active" → "design is active"
- "architecture beneath perception" → "design beneath perception"
- "architecture of Book One" → "design of Book One"
- "coherence architecture" → "coherence design"
- "Living Architecture" → "Living Design"
- "functional design architecture" → "functional design system"
- **Kept "architecture"** when referring to structural concepts that need that specific term

### 5. Updated "Consulting" to "The S2S Interface"

**About Page:**
- Replaced "consulting" with full definition: "The S2S Interface is a structural mapping process that brings the design of awareness into view. It reveals the movements, signals, timelines, and intelligences already shaping experience, allowing coherence to stabilize and new trajectories to emerge. This direct interaction works with individuals, organizations, groups, bodies of work, art, writing, concepts, and design."

## Language Patterns Established

**Instead of "field":**
- system, design, structure, framework, network, continuum

**Instead of "architecture":**
- design, structure, system, framework, pattern, blueprint

**Instead of negative affirmations:**
- Use affirmative statements
- Use "rather than" when contrast is needed
- Use "preserves" instead of "without collapsing"
- Use "functions as" instead of "is not"

## Notes

- "Sovereign Field" remains as a proper noun/concept name where it refers to the specific S2S concept
- "Sovereign Field Inquiry" remains as a proper term
- Some technical terms may still use "architecture" when it's the most precise term
- All changes maintain the poetic voice while adding structural clarity

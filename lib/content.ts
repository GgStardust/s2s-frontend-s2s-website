export const QUOTES = {
  systemRevealsItself: "A system reveals itself in the same way truth does: by arriving before language, waiting for attention to catch up.",
  
  longBeforeBook: "Long before this book was written, the field it describes was already moving. Its architecture existed in the form of instinct, coherence, emotional intelligence, and patterns that repeated themselves with precision. The structure lived beneath perception, shaping decisions, relationships, creativity, and identity with quiet inevitability.",
  
  whatYouAreEntering: "What you are entering is a field that predates its articulation. It functions as a field of intelligence that organizes itself without imposed structure. It is an expression of how consciousness actually behaves when it is whole, honest, and uncompressed. It maps the movements that occur inside every human life when awareness is given room to expand.",
  
  firstChangeValley: "The first change in the valley begins as a quiet stirring along the ground. It moves like a slow breath, loosening something within you before you notice what has begun. In this place, names begin to shift. Not the names given by others, but the deeper ones that hold your form from within.",
  
  bodyListens: "The body listens. Beneath the surface of skin and bone, beneath the familiar rhythms of breath and pulse, a deeper conversation unfolds. Cosmic signals arrive as vibration, as frequency, as resonance moving through the field.",
  
  consciousnessSpeaksToMatter: "Hum a single note. It vibrates through your entire body. This is how consciousness speaks to matter.",
  
  memoryAsStarlight: "Memory lives in your cells like starlight lives in the void. Patterns from distant origins move through you, carrying the intelligence of ancestral fields, the resonance of stellar inheritance, the architecture of recognition that spans time.",
  
  timeAsSpiral: "Time moves through you like a spiral, like parallel streams, like a permeable membrane. You inhabit multiple temporal dimensions simultaneously, your consciousness navigating rhythmic alignments that maintain field integrity across scales.",
  
  fieldMovesThroughYou: "The field moves through you and through others, creating a collective web of resonance that amplifies coherence across networks. Individual sovereignty and collective coherence exist as nested aspects of the same unified field.",
  
  bodyRemembers: "The body remembers what words remain beyond.",

// Homepage Section Content (Style-Training Aligned)
export const HOMEPAGE_SECTIONS = {
  paradigm: {
    paragraph1: "Consciousness behaves as structure. The body translates signal. Perception organizes identity. Memory and time shape what becomes possible. When these systems operate coherently, sovereignty emerges as a lived condition.",
    paragraph2: "Stardust to Sovereignty maps the path from current fragmentation to future coherence. It reveals the foundational architecture that existed before separation. The paradigm shows how to recognize and return to this original design, clearing layers of conditioning and distortion to reveal the structure that was always there. From that recovered foundation, consciousness advances with coherence. This is a functional model for reconnection and evolution.",

    intro: "This book is for people who want a clear model of how their inner system functions.",

      "Notice patterns before they have names",
      "Experience intelligence through sensation, movement, and bodily signal",
      "Value structure, clarity, and internal authority in complex situations",
      "Perceive reality through pattern, rhythm, and resonance",
      "Navigate high-stakes choices and seek internal coherence under pressure",
      "Feel scattered, stuck, or overdue for change and want a way to unify their inner world with clarity",

  glimpse: {
    paragraph1: "Sovereignty is a condition of coherence reclaimed.",
    paragraph2: "When perception, body signal, memory, and temporal awareness operate in alignment, decision-making becomes clean. Identity stabilizes. Attention returns to the present system rather than fragmenting across past conditioning or future projection.",
    paragraph3: "This book describes how intelligence organizes itself through form. It maps the reconnection process: recognizing foundational architecture, clearing distortion, and advancing from recovered coherence.",

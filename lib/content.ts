export const QUOTES = {
  systemRevealsItself: "A system reveals itself in the same way truth does: by arriving before language, waiting for attention to catch up.",
  
  longBeforeBook: "Long before this book was written, the field it describes was already moving. Its architecture existed in the form of instinct, coherence, emotional intelligence, and patterns that repeated themselves with precision. The structure lived beneath perception, shaping decisions, relationships, creativity, and identity with quiet inevitability.",
  
  whatYouAreEntering: "What you are entering is a field that predates its articulation. It functions as a field of intelligence that organizes itself without imposed structure. It is an expression of how consciousness actually behaves when it is whole, honest, and uncompressed. It maps the movements that occur inside every human life when awareness is given room to expand.",
  
  firstChangeValley: "The first change in the valley begins as a quiet stirring along the ground. It moves like a slow breath, loosening something within you before you notice what has begun. In this place, names begin to shift. Not the names given by others, but the deeper ones that hold your form from within.",
  
  bodyListens: "The body listens. Beneath the surface of skin and bone, beneath the familiar rhythms of breath and pulse, a deeper conversation unfolds. Cosmic signals arrive as vibration, as frequency, as resonance moving through the field.",
  
  consciousnessSpeaksToMatter: "Hum a single note. It vibrates through your entire body. This is how consciousness speaks to matter.",
  
  memoryAsStarlight: "Memory lives in your cells like starlight lives in the void. Patterns from distant origins move through you, carrying the intelligence of ancestral fields, the resonance of stellar inheritance, the architecture of recognition that spans time.",
  
  timeAsSpiral: "Time moves through you like a spiral, like parallel streams, like a permeable membrane. You inhabit multiple temporal dimensions simultaneously, your consciousness navigating rhythmic alignments that maintain field integrity across scales.",
  
  fieldMovesThroughYou: "The field moves through you and through others, creating a collective web of resonance that amplifies coherence across networks. Individual sovereignty and collective coherence exist as nested aspects of the same unified field.",
  
  bodyRemembers: "The body remembers what words remain beyond.",
